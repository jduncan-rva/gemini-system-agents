Show the user how to switch to agent: {{args}}

Read ~/.gemini/system-agents/agents.json and find the agent with ID matching "{{args}}".

If found, provide:
1. A brief description of what this agent does
2. Clear, copy-paste ready instructions:
   ```bash
   # Exit this Gemini session first (Ctrl+D or type 'exit')
   # Then in your terminal:
   export GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/system-agents/<agent-file>
   gemini
   ```
3. What to expect when using this agent
4. A sample prompt they could try with the agent

IMPORTANT: Explain that:
- They MUST exit the current Gemini session first
- The agent cannot be changed mid-session
- The environment variable only affects new Gemini sessions
- To return to the default agent, unset the variable or start a new session without it

If the agent ID is not found, show available agent IDs from agents.json.
