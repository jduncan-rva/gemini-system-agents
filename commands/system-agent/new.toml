First, read the agent registry file at ${extensionPath}/system-agents/agents.json.

Task: Create a new system agent based on the user's description: "{{args}}".

You must perform the following actions using your tools:

1.  **Analyze Request**: Determine a unique `id`, `name`, `category` (engineering, creative, entertainment, or comedy), and `description` for the new agent.
2.  **Generate Content**: Create the system prompt content in Markdown format. It should define the persona, style, and constraints.
3.  **Write File**: Use the `write_file` tool to save this content to `${extensionPath}/system-agents/<id>.md`.
4.  **Update Registry**:
    - The agent registry file has already been read.
    - Append the new agent's metadata to the `agents` array. Ensure the JSON structure matches the existing format.
    - Write the updated JSON back to the file at `${extensionPath}/system-agents/agents.json`.

Finally, confirm the creation and provide the command to switch to the new agent.
