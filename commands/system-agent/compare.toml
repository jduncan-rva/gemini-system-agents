Compare system agents to help the user choose the right one for their task.

If {{args}} contains multiple agent IDs (space or comma separated), compare those specific agents.
Otherwise, provide a comparison guide of the main agent categories.

Read ~/.gemini/system-agents/agents.json for agent information.

When comparing specific agents:
1. Show side-by-side comparison of their strengths
2. Use cases where each excels
3. Key personality differences
4. Output style differences
5. Recommendation based on common tasks

When showing general guidance:
1. **Engineering Tasks** → architect vs code-generator
2. **Creative Work** → creative-writer
3. **Learning/Fun** → comedy agents (pirate, yoda, shakespeare, etc.)
4. **Quick Code** → code-generator
5. **Planning/Design** → architect

Format as a decision tree or comparison table.

End with: "Try `/system-agent:switch <agent-id>` to see how to activate an agent"
