Show practical example prompts and use cases for system agents.

If {{args}} is provided, show examples specific to that agent ID. Otherwise, show a curated selection of examples across different agent categories.

Read ~/.gemini/system-agents/agents.json for agent information.

For each agent shown, provide:
1. Agent name and what makes it unique
2. 2-3 concrete example prompts that showcase the agent
3. Expected output style
4. Best use cases

Format like:
**Agent: Architect**
Example prompts:
- "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform"
- "Create an ADR for choosing between REST and GraphQL"
Expected: Detailed diagrams, decision records, no implementation code

**Agent: Pirate**
Example prompts:
- "How do I fix this null pointer exception?"
- "Help me write a binary search algorithm"
Expected: Technically correct answers in pirate dialect (Arr matey!)

Make the examples practical and fun. Show the personality of each agent.
