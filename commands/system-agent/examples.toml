First, read the system agent registry file at ${extensionPath}/system-agents/agents.json.
Then, attempt to read the custom agent registry file at ${extensionPath}/custom/agents.json. If it does not exist, treat it as empty.

Task: Provide example prompts and use cases for the agent '{{args}}' by searching both registries.
If no agent is specified in '{{args}}', pick 3 diverse agents (from both system and custom) to demonstrate.
Use the 'use_cases' field in the JSON as a base to generate specific, copy-pasteable example prompts.
