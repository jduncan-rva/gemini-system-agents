First, read the system agent registry file using `run_shell_command` with `cat ${extensionPath}/system-agents/agents.json`. **Do not use `read_file` as it is restricted to the workspace.**

Then, attempt to read the custom agent registry file using `run_shell_command` with `cat ${extensionPath}/custom/agents.json`. If the command fails (file doesn't exist), treat it as empty.

Task: List all available system agents by merging the agents from both registries.
Format the output as a clean, readable list. Clearly indicate which agents are 'Built-in' and which are 'Custom'.
For each agent, show:
- **ID** (for commands)
- **Name**
- **Category**
- **Description**
