List all available system agents from the system-agent-installer extension.

Read the agents.json file from ~/.gemini/system-agents/agents.json and display:

1. A categorized list of all agents
2. Each agent's name, file, and brief description
3. The command to activate each agent

Format the output clearly with:
- Category headers
- Agent names and IDs
- One-line descriptions
- Usage example for each: `export GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/system-agents/<filename>`

Remind users that they must exit this Gemini session and start a new one with the exported variable to use a different agent.
