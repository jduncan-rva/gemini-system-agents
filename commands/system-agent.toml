First, read the system agent registry file at ${extensionPath}/system-agents/agents.json.
Then, attempt to read the custom agent registry file at ${extensionPath}/custom/agents.json. If it does not exist, treat it as empty.

Task: List all available system agents by merging the agents from both registries.
Format the output as a clean, readable list. Clearly indicate which agents are 'Built-in' and which are 'Custom'.
For each agent, show:

- **Name**
- **Category**
- **Description**
